To practice passing values through props in React, you will build the gallery using mulitple components - an App, GalleryList, and GalleryItem.

App - represents the overall application or site
GalleryList - represents the gallery of images. By componentizing, we could reuse this component in different applications
GalleryItem - represents a single image in the gallery with the ability to click the image to toggle between image and description as well as the ability to like an image.
